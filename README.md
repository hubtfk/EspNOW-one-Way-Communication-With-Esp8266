## Key Features

- Wireless communication between NodeMCU devices
- Remote LED control using buttons
- ESP-NOW protocol implementation
- Simple and beginner-friendly IoT project

## Materials Used

- 2x NodeMCU ESP8266 Modules
- Push Buttons (D1 and D3)
- LEDs (D1 and D4)
- Jumper Wires

## Getting Started

### Wiring Diagram

Connect push buttons to sender/Transmitter nodemcu i used D1 & D3 pin in this code
Connect LED's to receiver nodemcu, i used D1 & D4 pin in this code

Ensure the wiring is set up as per the diagram before uploading the code to your NodeMCU devices.
